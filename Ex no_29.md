# EX 29 C program to create two float variables using calloc() and find minimum among them.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to create two float variables using calloc() and find minimum among them.

## Algorithm
Start. Initialize two variables value of calloc(). Prompt the user to enter values. Read the values using scanf. Find minimum and print result End

## Program:
```

Developed by: Deepasree S
RegisterNumber:  212222060036
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
 int *num1, *num2, minimum;
 num1 = (int *)calloc(1, sizeof(int));
 num2 = (int *)calloc(1, sizeof(int));
 num1= 5.8 , num2 = 6.5;
 minimum = (*num1 < *num2) ? *num1 : *num2;
 printf("%d\n", minimum);
 free(num1);
 free(num2);
