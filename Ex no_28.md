# EX 28 C program that demonstrates the use of enum (enumeration) type to define and use named integer constants.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of enum (enumeration) type to define and use named integer constants.

## Algorithm
1. Start. 2.
2. Declare enum
3. type Declare all days in a week Print result End

## Program:
```
/*
C program that demonstrates the use of enum (enumeration) type to define and use named integer constants.
Developed by: Deepasree S
RegisterNumber:  212222060036

enum weekdays {
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
};
int main() {
 enum weekdays today = Wednesday;
 if (today == Wednesday) {
 printf("Today is Wednesday.\n");
 }
}
*/
