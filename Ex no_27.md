# EX 27 C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

## Algorithm
Start. Declare a variable value of type char. Prompt the user to enter a value. Read the value using scanf. Check eligible for marriage. If age >= 21, print "Eligible". If false, print " Not Eligible". End.

## Program:
```
/*

Developed by: Deepasree S
RegisterNumber:  212222060036
#include <stdio.h>
typedef int MyInt;
int main() {
 MyInt num = 10;
printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num);
return 0;
 }
*/
```

## Output:

<img width="460" height="199" alt="515539487-87c29cd0-75ac-432d-ace1-9ba498f8773d" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bc0c83f-9cf2-4cdf-ab29-98deaa43432a" />


## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
